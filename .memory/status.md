# DS4 Rust Port Status

- Date: 2026-05-22 UTC
- Branch: `main`
- Starting oracle commit: `6975b57c196255e8ac4a22bb3be4dca18b92ebba`
- Active item: M0.4 Server Trace Baselines
- Last validated source commit: `9e35378f7f759fb63d3591641d6e9b65a9f0672b`
- Active debugging ledger: none
- B300 context: `hou2-prod1`
- B300 namespace: `default`
- B300 pod: `ds4-rust-port-b300`
- B300 node: `c1v17-b300n1-nic1`
- B300 temp kubeconfig: `/tmp/ds4-hou2-prod1.kubeconfig` for this local
  session; regenerate a temp copy in future sessions instead of treating this
  path as durable.
- Known local validation constraint: `ds4flash.gguf` is not present in the
  workspace, so model-backed tests and benchmark baselines need a model path or
  remote B300 execution.
- B300 model path: `/workspace/ds4/ds4flash.gguf`
- B300 model SHA256:
  `efc7ed607ff27076e3e501fc3fefefa33c0ed8cf1eff483a2b7fdc0c2e616668`
- B300 model size: 86,720,111,488 bytes.

## Last Evidence

- `git status --short` was clean before M0.1 edits.
- `AGENT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `RUST_PORT_ROADMAP.md` were read before
  creating the protocol.
- M0.1 validation passed with `git diff --name-only` and `git diff --check`.
- M0.1 Claude review returned PASS before commit.
- M0.2 local arm64 validation captured `arch -arm64 make` exit 0,
  `arch -arm64 make cpu` exit 0, `./ds4_test --server` exit 0, and
  `./ds4_test --metal-kernels` exit 0.
- M0.2 local default `make` and model-backed `make test` failures are recorded
  in `ds4-parity/baselines/manifest.md` with exact logs.
- M0.2 B300 validation captured `make cuda-generic` exit 0,
  `make cuda-regression` exit 0, `./ds4_test --server` exit 0, and
  `./ds4_test --metal-kernels` exit 0 on `ds4-rust-port-b300`.
- M0.3 B300 validation downloaded q2-imatrix, recorded model hash/size, built
  `ds4_test`, and captured `./ds4_test --logprob-vectors` exit 0 with
  `logprob-vectors: OK`.
