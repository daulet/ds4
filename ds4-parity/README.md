# DS4 Parity Artifacts

This directory stores oracle captures and future Rust comparison fixtures.

- `baselines/`: current C/CUDA/Metal command captures used as the oracle for
  early port work.
- Future fixture roots should be added by milestone and should include a
  manifest entry that names the oracle, input fixture, comparator, acceptance
  rule, command, environment, output files, and drift policy.

Do not treat a log file as proof by itself. A manifest entry must explain which
behavior the log proves and which requirements remain blocked or deferred.
